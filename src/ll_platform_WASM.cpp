  P175: LambPlatform for wasm32 (WASI and Emscripten alike).

  This is the wasm sibling of ll_platform_AMD64.cpp / ll_platform_ARM64.cpp: it supplies
  millis()/micros()/delay and the LambPlatform hooks, and nothing else.  The interpreter core
  needs no wasm-specific code at all -- see the P175 table of "what is already in our favour".

//! CLOCK_MONOTONIC, NOT CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID -- AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THIS TARGET
//! DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM THE NATIVE HOSTS.
//!
//! ll_platform_AMD64.cpp uses process CPU time on purpose, so benchmark timings and the GC-load%%
//! heap-expansion trigger are immune to OS descheduling.  Under WASI there is no process CPU
//! clock: `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID` exists only in wasi-libc's *emulation* library
//! (-lwasi-emulated-process-clocks), and that emulation returns WALL TIME -- so asking for it
//! would buy the name without the property, which is worse than not asking, because the next
//! reader would believe the timings were deschedule-proof.
//!
//! THE CONSEQUENCE, AND IT IS NOT A DEFECT HERE: on wasm these numbers are wall clock, so they
//! move with host load, with JIT tiering, and (in a browser) with tab throttling.  That is
//! acceptable because THIS TARGET MUST NEVER PUBLISH A TIMING NUMBER.  P175: "a WASM demo is a
//! LANGUAGE demo.  If it ever displays a timing number, that rule has been broken."  w3_test.sh
//! already classifies host performance as `diagnostic` for the same reason.
