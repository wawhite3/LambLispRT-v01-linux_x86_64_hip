//! TWO MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BACKENDS FOR THE SAME API.  Read this before editing either.

//!   LL_ARDUINO     = 1  -> build against LAMBLISP'S OWN implementation ("LLArduino").
//!
//! RENAMED 2026-09-18 (B485).  These were `LL_ARDUINO` (Espressif) and `LLARDUINO` (ours) -- ONE
//! UNDERSCORE APART, MEANING OPPOSITE THINGS, and `LLARDUINO` was the only flag in the codebase
//! not carrying the `LL_` prefix every other one uses.  That cost an hour of red master across the
//! whole fleet: `delay_ms` is declared only under OUR backend, a call to it from shared code
//! compiled on the host and broke every ESP32 target, and the author had read the declaration line
//! and still not seen which guard it sat under.  The names now differ by a whole token, and the
//! one that means "Espressif's core" finally SAYS so.
//!
//! Note the swap when reading history: before this rename, `LL_ARDUINO` meant Espressif's core --
//! the OPPOSITE of what it means now.  A commit older than 2026-09-18 that tests `LL_ARDUINO` is

//! runs on it, and the Windows (MinGW) and WebAssembly targets CANNOT use Espressif's core at all -- there

//! Size of the NCG executable (D/IRAM) pool.  This comes out of INTERNAL DRAM, the same scarce

//! -DLL_NCG_EXEC_POOL_BYTES=<bytes> per env; larger only buys more simultaneously-resident NCG code.
//! LL_NCG_DIRAM_POOL -- NAMED FOR THE CAPABILITY, NOT THE CHIP.
//! The pool needs one property: a D/IRAM ALIAS REGION, where the same physical block is writable
//! through a DRAM address and executable through an IRAM address.  BOTH the ESP32 (LX6) and the
//! ESP32-S3 (LX7) have one, and the IDF exposes it identically via esp_ptr_in_diram_dram() /
//! esp_ptr_diram_dram_to_iram() in esp_memory_utils.h -- a COMMON component, not an S3 one.
//! This guard was `#if LL_ESP32S3` and that was wrong in a way that cost real time: the LX6 boards
//! (4WD, WROVER) got NO pool, every NCG compile fell through to heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_EXEC)
//! -- which has ~368 bytes because the IRAM-only region is consumed by static code -- and so NCG
//! HAS NEVER RUN on those boards.
//!
//! **CORRECTED 2026-09-16: THE POOL IS A RESERVATION, NOT AN ACCESS MECHANISM, AND THE ~368 BYTES
//! MEASURE ONLY ONE OF TWO EXECUTABLE REGIONS.**  Measured on Freenove-ESP32-WROVER with NO POOL AT
//! ALL (`(ncg-exec-pool-tiers)` -> `((diram 0 0))`, because WiFi's reservation preceded it):
//! **29 of 40 procedures compiled to native, 56,753 bytes**, every one of them through the
//! `heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_EXEC)` path this note calls unusable.  154x the figure above.
//!
//! WHY, from the ESP32 memory map in soc.h:182-199 --
//!     SOC_IRAM_LOW       0x40080000   SOC_IRAM_HIGH       0x400AA000
//!     SOC_DIRAM_IRAM_LOW 0x400A0000   SOC_DIRAM_IRAM_HIGH 0x400C0000
//!     SOC_DIRAM_DRAM_LOW 0x3FFE0000   SOC_DIRAM_DRAM_HIGH 0x40000000
//! **The IRAM window OVERLAPS the D/IRAM region** (0x400A0000-0x400AA000), so MALLOC_CAP_EXEC is
//! not confined to the IRAM-ONLY area that static code consumes -- it also draws from D/IRAM, which
//! is the SAME PHYSICAL SRAM the pool reserves.  Confirmed from the addresses: native code compiled
//! on the WROVER with no pool landed at 0x3fff0030, 0x3fff042c, 0x3fff0460 -- inside
//! SOC_DIRAM_DRAM, not in the IRAM-only window.
//!
//! SO THE POOL'S VALUE IS TIMING, NOT CAPABILITY.  D/IRAM is dual-bus and executable whether or not
//! anything reserved it; `heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_EXEC)` takes it on demand.  What the pool buys
//! is claiming that memory EARLY, before the `.scm` chain and the radio spend the same region as
//! DATA.  "NCG has never run on those boards" described a state in which D/IRAM had been exhausted
//! by the time anything tried to compile -- not a hardware limit, and not a property of
//! MALLOC_CAP_EXEC.  Do not read the ~368 figure as the executable memory available on an LX6.
//!
//! **THE NUMBER WAS ON THE CONSOLE THE WHOLE TIME.**  `main.cpp:201` prints, at every boot, 43 ms
//! in, before LambLisp claims anything:
//!
//!     [43] ::setup() free EXEC/IRAM heap: 110924 bytes          <- Freenove-ESP32-WROVER
//!
//! **110,924 bytes free**, while this note said ~368 and called 32 KB "the only fast exec memory it
//! will ever have".  The silicon reason is the ESP32 datasheet's three-block internal SRAM:
//! SRAM0 (192 KB, instruction bus), **SRAM1 (128 KB, BOTH buses -- 0x3FFE0000-0x40000000 as data,
//! 0x400A0000-0x400C0000 as instructions)**, SRAM2 (200 KB, data only).  SRAM1 is one physical
//! memory behind two windows, so anything written through the data view executes through the
//! instruction view; `SOC_DIRAM_INVERTED 1` only means that view runs backwards on this part.
//!
//! SO THERE ARE TWO EXECUTABLE REGIONS AND THE ~368 MEASURED THE OTHER ONE.  The SRAM0 tail
//! (0x40080000-0x400A0000) is executable but is where static code links, and lies outside
//! SOC_BYTE_ACCESSIBLE (which ends at 0x40000000) so it is MALLOC_CAP_32BIT rather than 8BIT.  That
//! region really does have ~368 bytes free.  It is not the region generated code lands in.
//!
//! WHAT IS STILL TRUE: SRAM1's 128 KB is CONTESTED -- the .scm chain, LittleFS buffers and the radio
//! all draw from it as DATA -- so the usable figure is whatever remains, not 128 KB, and there is no
//! overflow tier when it is gone.  That is the real mechanism behind "NCG has never run on those
//! boards": a race for SRAM1, not a hardware wall.
//!
//! AND THE LESSON, which is the same one P211 paid for the same day: a printed number read through a
//! belief that makes it unremarkable is not evidence, it is decoration.  `after setup.scm load` had
//! shown 70 KB for months and was read as "the Scheme library is expensive" rather than "one form
//! costs 48 KB".  This one had shown 110,924 at every boot.  It presents as `alloc_exec: heap_caps_malloc(N) FAILED` and
//! then as tests that quietly SKIP because the driver could not be compiled.
//! Keying a capability off a chip model also means the only way to enable it on another chip is to
//! claim to BE that chip, which puts a false -DLL_ESP32S3 on a non-S3 board and breaks every other
//! thing that flag legitimately selects.  Name the capability; let each SoC declare whether it has it.

//! ESP32-C3 / C6 (RISC-V) -- WHY THEY ARE NOT IN THIS LIST YET.
//! The ADDRESSING is already solved for them: the C3 has the same aliased D/IRAM shape as the
//! S3 (soc.h SOC_DIRAM_DRAM_LOW 0x3FC80000 / IRAM_LOW 0x40380000, no SOC_DIRAM_INVERTED) and on
//! the C6 both LOWs are 0x40800000, so esp_ptr_diram_dram_to_iram() degenerates to the identity
//! and alloc_exec's per-word mapping is correct on both AS WRITTEN, with no #if.
//! What is NOT solved is PERMISSION, and it is a different question from addressing: the stock
//! Arduino sdkconfig ships CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_MEMPROT_FEATURE=y (+ _LOCK=y) on the C3 and
//! CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PMP_IDRAM_SPLIT=y on the C6, and the IDF's own Kconfig says allocating with
//! MALLOC_CAP_EXEC is not possible while that is on.  The S3 works only because ITS shipped
//! config has memprot OFF -- a Kconfig default, NOT a capability the C-series lost
//! (SOC_CPU_IDRAM_SPLIT_USING_PMP is a switch; MALLOC_CAP_EXEC is still defined there).
//! So this is a BUILD-CONFIGURATION question with a known switch, not a hardware wall -- and it
//! requires a real C3 and a real C6 and has NOT been run.  Turning the pool
//! on here without that measurement would claim a capability nobody has observed; leaving it off
//! costs only speed, because a failed alloc_exec makes ncg_compile fall back to the bytecode
//! interpreter, which is a supported state.  When Phase 0 passes, add the chip here AND give it
//! its own LL_NCG_EXEC_POOL_BYTES measured against a LittleFS read in the same run.
//! The `&& !LL_RISCV32` is load-bearing, not tidiness: a C-series env sets -DLL_ESP32=1 (it needs
//! heap_caps, Arduino and the 32-bit Word_t), so without it the pool would switch ON for a chip that
//! has no D/IRAM ALIAS REGION -- which is the one property this pool requires.
//!
//! [P200 stale-claim sweep, 2026-09-24] THAT REASON USED TO READ "a chip whose Phase 0 has never been
//! run", AND THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE OF THE C5.  P173 Phase 0 ran and PASSED on 2026-09-12 (c898846,
//! a43b6b8): the C5 executes bytes it wrote at runtime.  The exclusion is still correct, but for the
//! reason above rather than for ignorance -- a C-series part has ONE address space
//! (SOC_MMU_DI_VADDR_SHARED), so there is no alias to key this pool off, and the C5 gets its on-die
//! executable memory through a DIFFERENT macro: LL_NCG_RISCV_POOL, gated on LL_C5_NCG_ARENA (or the
//! shipped-disabled LL_C5_PMP_RWX).  See the LL_NCG_RISCV_POOL block below and [B382], where turning
//! that tier on moved gc-ctrl-worst from 269us to 6us on the deliverable env.
//! Keeping the old wording would have been the failure CLAUDE.md names: a right guard behind a wrong
//! reason, which reads as settled and removes anyone's reason to check.  It would not fail politely either -- ncg_exec_pool_init()
//! only checks that the block is IN the D/IRAM range, which it is, so the pool would be USED and
//! the first call into it would fault on the PMP/PMS split, i.e. a crash instead of the graceful
//! "compile fell back to bytecode".

//! LL_NCG_RISCV_POOL -- the same idea as LL_NCG_DIRAM_POOL, for a C-series part whose PMP split
//! has been cleared.  RESERVE EARLY OR NOT AT ALL: measured on c5-01, internal DRAM free is
//! ~106 KB at pool-init time (largest block ~90 KB), ~33 KB once idle at the REPL, and ~10 KB
//! during a perf sweep -- at which point a 2,180-byte exec allocation FAILS on fragmentation, and
//! the NCG column comes out empty for a reason that has nothing to do with code generation
//! (P173 sec.11.6f).  A pool taken at init survives that, because it is taken before the heap is
//! carved up.
//!
//! EVERY W^X STATEMENT IN THIS FILE IS ABOUT **INTERNAL SRAM**, AND NEVER ABOUT PSRAM.  [B408]
//! On both the S3 and the C5, ALL PSRAM is simultaneously writable and executable, and neither
//! part offers any mechanism to subdivide it or mark a region non-executable -- so there is no
//! W^X property to enforce or lose there, whatever the PMP is doing on-die.  This matters because
//! the NCG's executable pool lives in exactly that memory on the tiers that use PSRAM: an
//! unqualified "the PMP enforces W^X" is true of the SRAM path and false of the memory the
//! generated code actually runs in, and a reader who takes the general reading concludes this
//! system has a memory-protection property it does not have.  Say which memory, every time.
//!
//! CONDITIONED ON LL_C5_PMP_RWX, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING.  Without the flag the PMP still
//! enforces W^X ON INTERNAL SRAM, so this pool would be allocated, would pass any range check, would be USED, and
//! the first call into it would fault -- turning a graceful fall-back-to-bytecode into a crash.
//! That is exactly the failure the LL_NCG_DIRAM_POOL comment above warns about for a chip whose
//! Phase 0 has not been run, and the same reasoning applies here in reverse: the flag IS the
//! evidence that Phase 0 passed on this build.
//!
//! NO D/IRAM ALIAS, DELIBERATELY.  The Xtensa pool keeps two pointers because instruction and data
//! reach the same bytes through different windows.  A C-series part has SOC_MMU_DI_VADDR_SHARED
//! -- one address space -- so the write pointer and the exec pointer are the same value, and
//! translating would be wrong rather than merely redundant.
//! B382/B389, P173 sec.12.3 option (c): THE ON-DIE TIER NO LONGER REQUIRES DISABLING W^X
//! ON INTERNAL SRAM.
//! It used to be gated on LL_C5_PMP_RWX alone, which empties esp_cpu_configure_region_protection()
//! and leaves ALL internal SRAM writable AND executable -- "Do not ship enabled", per that file's
//! own banner, and B367 removed it from the deliverable envs for exactly that reason.  The cost of
//! removing it was measured in B382: with no on-die tier every NCG function executes from PSRAM
//! over quad-SPI and `gc-ctrl-worst` went 6 us -> 273 us, a 45x latency regression that a
//! throughput benchmark cannot see (allocation rate differed by 0.4%).
//!
//! LL_C5_NCG_ARENA is the W^X-PRESERVING route to the same tier: w3_c5_pmp_arena.c owns the PMP
//! layout and carves ONE naturally-aligned RWX region for generated code, leaving the IDRAM split
//! intact everywhere else.  So either flag enables the on-die pool, and they are mutually
//! exclusive by #error in that file -- both replace the same symbol.

//! flag, so a build that KEPT W^X got no native code generation at all -- making a customer C5 a
//! choice between NCG and memory protection that the hardware never required.
//! From the C5's own cpu_region_protect.c: with CONFIG_SPIRAM_PRE_CONFIGURE_MEMORY_PROTECTION unset
//! (it is), the MSPI window takes `PMP_ENTRY_SET(6, NAPOT(IROM), RWX)`, commented "Add the W
//! attribute in the case of PSRAM".  That entry is INDEPENDENT of CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PMP_IDRAM_SPLIT,
//! which governs INTERNAL SRAM only -- so PSRAM executability was never blocked by the split, and

//! THE DIVISION OF LABOUR:
//!   LL_NCG_RISCV_POOL  (internal 32 KB, hot)  -- NEEDS the flag.  Without it the PMP still enforces
//!       W^X on internal SRAM, so that pool would allocate, pass every range check, be USED, and
//!       fault on the first call into it.  Keep it flag-gated.
//!   LL_NCG_PSRAM_EXEC  (on demand, unbounded) -- needs only a part with PSRAM.
//! A build WITHOUT the flag therefore keeps W^X on internal SRAM, loses the fast tier, and still
//! generates native code into PSRAM.  Running out of fast memory costs SPEED, not the whole tier.

//! LL_NCG_PSRAM_EXEC -- CAN GENERATED CODE RUN FROM PSRAM ON THIS TARGET?
//!
//! This replaced a POOL (LL_NCG_XMMU_POOL / LL_NCG_PSRAM_POOL, both with a 1 MB cap) on 2026-09-14.
//! The pool mapped a fixed arena with esp_mmu_map() and bump-allocated from it, and every part of
//! that turned out to be unnecessary -- P173 sec.13.11 has the full argument; the short form:
//!
//!   * ALL PSRAM IS ALREADY EXECUTABLE ON BOTH ARCHITECTURES, and neither the pool nor esp_mmu_map
//!     made it so.  Measured on three boards.  See B408: there is no mechanism on either part to
//!     make any PSRAM non-executable, so this is a property of the silicon, not a grant.
//!   * THE FRAGMENTATION ARGUMENT INVERTS AT THIS SIZE.  "Reserve early or not at all" is real and
//!     measured -- in INTERNAL DRAM (P173 sec.11.6f: ~10 KB free mid-sweep, a 2,180-byte request
//!     refused).  That is why LL_NCG_EXEC_POOL_BYTES below still reserves.  PSRAM has 1.6-15 MB
//!     free, and the POOL is the fragile allocation there: it wants ONE CONTIGUOUS 192 KB-1 MB
//!     block, while a compiled procedure wants 200 B-2 KB.  Fragmentation kills large contiguous
//!     requests and spares small ones, so the reservation defended only against a failure it
//!     created.
//!   * A BUMP ARENA CAN NEVER RECLAIM.  On-demand allocation can heap_caps_free() a procedure that
//!     is discarded; that is why both pool caps existed at all, and why B389 called the pool a
//!     permanent claim on system memory.
//!
//! DO NOT REINTRODUCE A CAP HERE.  A cap on an on-demand allocator would only stop native code
//! being generated while memory remained -- the exact failure an "overflow tier" exists to prevent.

//! LL_EXTRAM_SEPARATE_IBUS -- IS EXTERNAL RAM REACHED THROUGH A SEPARATE INSTRUCTION-BUS WINDOW?
//! [P200 R3, 2026-09-24]  NAMED FOR THE CAPABILITY, NOT THE CHIP, and it answers a question none of
//! the four macros around it answers.
//!
//! THE DISTINCTION FROM LL_NCG_PSRAM_ALIAS BELOW IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT IS ALREADY WRITTEN AT
//! THE CALL SITE: the four `(ncg-exec-probe)` sites in ll_vm_ncg_core.cpp say they are "WIDER THAN
//! LL_NCG_PSRAM_ALIAS ON PURPOSE", because the probe must be able to ask *COULD this part do it?* on
//! a part where the tier is DISABLED -- otherwise the probe can only confirm what the build already
//! believes, which is not a measurement.  The classic ESP32 is exactly that case: excluded from
//! LL_NCG_PSRAM_EXEC (its D/IRAM window is address-INVERTED), and the exclusion is worth TESTING
//! rather than asserting.  Every macro nearby is a TIER-ENABLED predicate; this one is a SILICON
//! predicate.  That is why the sites could not use one of them and spelled the question by hand.
//!
//! WHAT IT REPLACES, AND WHY THAT SPELLING WAS WRONG.  Those four sites read `LL_ESP32 && !LL_RISCV32`
//! -- the SDK axis AND NOT the ISA axis, i.e. a DOUBLE NEGATIVE for a positive fact.  It is correct
//! today only because every Espressif env happens to set exactly one of LL_XTENSA / LL_RISCV32
//! (verified across all 12 on 2026-09-24, and `verify_truth.sh` section 17 now ASSERTS it, so the
//! substitution is safe by construction rather than by a sweep somebody has to remember to redo).
//! An env that forgot `-DLL_XTENSA=1` would still satisfy `!LL_RISCV32` and quietly take the Xtensa
//! arm -- which is the [B306] failure one axis over: that bug selected the Xtensa NCG backend on
//! `LL_ESP32` alone and would have compiled Xtensa opcodes into a RISC-V build.
//!
//! THE FACT ITSELF: Xtensa parts reach external RAM through two windows onto one MMU entry (data
//! 0x3C......, instruction 0x42...... on the S3), so bytes written through a data pointer are not
//! fetchable at that pointer and the cache must be written back before an instruction fetch.  A
//! C-series part has SOC_MMU_DI_VADDR_SHARED -- ONE address space -- so the write pointer IS the exec
//! pointer, and both the transform and the writeback would be wrong rather than merely redundant.
//! Hence: this is the property that makes LL_NCG_PSRAM_ALIAS's transform MEANINGFUL at all.
//!
//! IF A FUTURE PART DISAGREES, CHANGE IT HERE.  It is 1:1 with LL_XTENSA on every part that exists
//! today; it is a separate name because the two are separate QUESTIONS, and the day a RISC-V part
//! ships a split instruction window this definition is the one line that moves.

//! LL_NCG_PSRAM_ALIAS -- does this target need the DBUS->IBUS address transform, or is the data

//!
//!   Xtensa S3: TRANSFORM.  Data and instructions reach PSRAM through different windows
//!              (0x3C…… and 0x42……) onto the same MMU entry, so the exec pointer is
//!              `w - SOC_DRAM0_CACHE_ADDRESS_LOW + SOC_IRAM0_CACHE_ADDRESS_LOW`.  This is the same
//!              shape as LL_NCG_DIRAM_POOL's D/IRAM alias for internal memory, one window further
//!              out.  Verified on esp32-s3-devkitc-1 (2 MB quad) and esp32s3-n32r16-00 (16 MB
//!              octal), at linear offsets 0x2686b0 and 0x392524 -- different memory types, different
//!              regions of the window, both `P173-ALIAS result=42`.
//!   RISC-V C5: NONE.  SOC_MMU_DI_VADDR_SHARED -- one address space, so the write pointer IS the
//!              exec pointer and a transform would be wrong rather than redundant.
//!
//! THE CLASSIC ESP32 (LX6) IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED FROM LL_NCG_PSRAM_EXEC ABOVE, and this is the
//! reason: its D/IRAM window is address-INVERTED (SOC_DIRAM_INVERTED), which already cost this
//! codebase one HANG-not-a-crash when a sequential memcpy through the DRAM alias laid an
//! instruction stream out backwards -- see the note in NcgBuffer::alloc_exec.  Its external window

//! WHY A CONSTANT AND NOT A MEASUREMENT AT RUNTIME: the reservation must be made BEFORE the radio
//! runs, so there is nothing to measure yet.  That makes this a number that WILL drift as the IDF's
//! WiFi stack changes, and drift silently, which is the defect this whole proposal exists to fight.
//! The mitigation is that it is best-effort in BOTH directions -- an under-reserve leaves the radio
//! to allocate the remainder as it does today, an over-reserve is handed back at WiFi.begin() -- so
//! being wrong costs ordering quality, never correctness.  Re-measure it with the form note when
//! the IDF moves; the note is threshold-gated and prints only when something crosses 2 KB.
//!
//! 48 KB, not 48,752: a reservation is a hole, and a round hole is easier to reason about than a

//! stops at pool_free < 4096, and the last compile overshoots (measured: 1608 free of 32768,
//! [B389]).  Doing that at BOOT means every procedure the user defines afterwards, and every test
//! that compiles one, starts against a pool that is already spent.  On the host this is free --
//! the pool is megabytes -- so a green host build says nothing about it.  [B389] is the open
//! measurement of what that costs; do not read a passing linux run as clearance for a board.
//! DEFAULT 1 -- COMPILE EVERYTHING TO BYTECODE, NOTHING TO NATIVE.  Not a compromise; it follows
//! from where the two things live.  BYTECODE IS ORDINARY HEAP.  NATIVE CODE IS THE 32 KB EXEC
//! POOL.  Compiling every procedure to bytecode costs nothing scarce.  Compiling them to native
//! spends a small fixed shared resource that is never reclaimed -- so native must be rationed, and
//! rationing by "whatever the environment hash-walk reaches first" is not rationing.
//!
//! MEASURED on esp32s3-n8r2-00, 2026-09-14, with the blanket LL_AUTOCOMPILE=2 this replaces:
//!
//!     auto-compile: 230 procedures compiled
//!     ncg_compile_env() exec budget spent -- stopping (pool free 2896 of 32768)
//!     ncg-compile: 18 procedures compiled
//!     execution modes: AST 2  BC 212  NCG 18  (232 procedures)
//!
//! 18 of 230 reached native -- 8% -- for 91% of the pool.  The 18 were whichever the walk reached
//! first: WS2812.setAll, WS2812.setLedColorData, Buzzer.click, Sonar.start, diffie-hellman-keygen,
//! define-library, csv-opt, cddadr ... device drivers and rare library calls.  The pool bought
//! nothing and was then unavailable to code that mattered -- including the benchmark harness, which
//! must get ~14 procedures native to measure the NCG path at all ([B343] is what a perf row looks
//! like when it silently does not).
//!
//! IT IS NOT "FAST RAM".  IT IS LOW-LATENCY RAM, AND THE DIFFERENCE DECIDES THE WHOLE POLICY
//! (owner, 2026-09-21).  On-die SRAM runs at roughly CACHE speed -- not faster than cached PSRAM,
//! just never slower.  A hot function is cache-friendly by definition: it is fetched once and
//! hits thereafter, so moving it on-die buys almost nothing on average.  That is not a guess, it
//! is the P37 measurement two blocks up: pool residency is worth 0.022%-0.157% of THROUGHPUT.
//! What the pool actually buys is that a fetch stall CANNOT HAPPEN -- a worst-case guarantee, of
//! value to a control loop with a deadline and of almost none to anything else.
//!
//! SO THE PER-PART PICTURE IS NOT "FASTER MEMORY, RATION IT":
//!   S3, C5     PSRAM is EXECUTABLE and there are megabytes of it.  Native code belongs there by
//!              default.  The on-die pool is a latency EXCEPTION, requested per procedure.
//!   WROVER     PSRAM is NOT executable, so internal SRAM is the only place native code can live
//!              at all.  There the pool is a capability, not an optimisation -- and note it is
//!              reached through heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_EXEC), which draws on the whole
//!              128 KB D/IRAM region rather than a pre-reserved 32 KB slice of it.
//!
//! AND THEREFORE PINNING, NOT A HEURISTIC.  Which procedures need a latency guarantee is an
//! APPLICATION fact -- it depends on which loop has a deadline, and the runtime cannot know that.
//! Any heuristic the VM could apply (size, call count, compile order) is a proxy for something it
//! cannot see, and the measured cost of guessing is on record: a hash-walk order gave 91% of the
//! pool to WS2812.setAll, Buzzer.click, cddadr and define-library.  `compile-low-latency!` lets
//! the application say which, and that is the whole mechanism -- there is deliberately no
//! automatic promotion into this tier, on any part.  [B527] made the RISC-V arm honour it; it had
//! been taking the pool first-come because it could not see the request flag.
//!
//! SO: 1 here, with SELECTIVE native compilation layered on top -- a prioritised, per-application
//! list ([P205]).  That needs no new C++: `procedure->bytecode` puts a procedure in bytecode,
//! `ncg-compile-transitive!` takes it native, and bench-runner has driven both from an explicit
//! list for months.  What is missing is only where the list lives and who supplies it per target.
//!
//! wasm gets 1 and never 2: LL_NCG is 0 there (the host engine already JITs).  The linux_x86_64_bc
//! (=1) and linux_x86_64_ncg (=2) diagnostic envs set it explicitly and are unaffected; on a host

//! dropped by the UART.  Nothing reports it, so a healthy board looks dead.  Measured on
//! esp32s3-n8r2-00: 453 bytes evaluated, 513 did not, and the cliff moved with how busy the control
//! loop was -- which is the signature of a ring overrun rather than a fixed parser limit.
//!
//! COSTS INTERNAL DRAM, which is the scarcest thing on these parts (B389 dies with 324 bytes left,
//! B396 starves WiFi).  2048 is chosen as the smallest size that clears every probe this project
//! actually sends by a wide margin, for +1792 bytes over the default -- NOT the largest that fits.
//! Raising it is spending from an overdrawn account; measure before you do.
//! CONSOLE BUFFERS -- THESE CANNOT GO IN PSRAM, AND THE SIZE IS A DIRECT INTERNAL-DRAM COST.
//!
//! Do not "move them to PSRAM" by raising the size past the default-malloc threshold (set at the
//! `heap_caps_malloc_extmem_enable` call in `ll_platform_ESP32.cpp` -- not the sdkconfig value,
//! which that call overrides).  That threshold governs capability-less malloc() only; the UART
//! driver does not use one.
//! `esp_driver_uart/src/uart.c` allocates BOTH rings with an explicit capability:
//!
//!     #define UART_MALLOC_CAPS  (MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT)
//!     uart_obj->rx_ring_buf = xRingbufferCreateWithCaps(rx_buffer_size, ..., UART_MALLOC_CAPS);
//!     uart_obj->tx_ring_buf = xRingbufferCreateWithCaps(tx_buffer_size, ..., UART_MALLOC_CAPS);
//!
//! So every byte of these buffers is internal DRAM at ANY size, and raising the number spends from
//! the account WiFi.begin() draws on.  Measured on the WROVER, same binary, one variable: a 2048
//! ring boot-looped the board with the bench overlay staged (7 aborts, 7 reboots) while 256 booted
//! clean, and the internal free difference was ~1992 bytes -- which is itself the proof they are
//! internal, since a PSRAM-backed ring would have shown no difference at all.
//!
//! B410 (a long REPL line silently dropped) is therefore NOT fixable by enlarging this.  The fix is
//! to drain promptly into a buffer WE allocate in PSRAM -- see P208; the driver ring then only has
//! to cover drain latency rather than a whole ~1300-byte LLIP frame.  Until that exists, the ring
//! stays at the framework default and the OVERFLOW IS REPORTED instead of being silent, which costs
