  //! scheduling, all of which mean elapsed REAL time.  On embedded the two clocks are effectively
  //! the same, so only the Linux hosts diverged -- which is precisely the host/device difference
  //! P176 exists to remove.  There are no perf measurements on the Linux targets that wanted CPU
  //! time; if one is ever needed, add a SEPARATELY NAMED helper rather than redefining these.
  //! Found by the LLArduino conformance suite: "delay_us(2000) elapsed >= 1ms" failed while a
  //! wall-clock measurement around the whole process proved the sleep itself was real.
